      <h2>Team membership policy</h2>

      <p>
        There are four kinds of policy that describe who can be a member and
        how new memberships are handled. The choice of policy reflects the
        need to build a community versus the need to control Launchpad assets.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Open</dt>
        <dd>
          Membership is open, no approval required, and subteams can be open
          or closed. Any user can be a member of the team and no approval is
          required. Subteams can be Open, Delegated, Moderated, or Restricted.
          Open is a good choice for encouraging a community of contributors.
          Open teams cannot have PPAs.
        </dd>

        <dt>Delegated</dt>
        <dd>
          Membership is open, requires approval, and subteams can be open or
          closed. Any user can be a member of the team via a subteam, but team
          administrators approve direct memberships. Subteams can be Open,
          Delegated, Moderated, or Restricted. Delegated is a good choice for
          managing a large community of contributors. Delegated teams cannot
          have PPAs.
        </dd>

        <dt>Moderated</dt>
        <dd>
          Membership is closed, requires approval, and subteams must be
          closed. Any user can propose a new member, but team administrators
          approve membership. Subteams must be Moderated or Restricted.
          Moderated is a good choice for teams that manage things that need to
          be secure, like projects, branches, or PPAs, but want to encourage
          users to help.
        </dd>

        <dt>Restricted</dt>
        <dd>
          Membership is closed, requires approval, and subteams must be
          closed. Only the team's administrators can invite a user to be a
          member. Subteams must be Moderated or Restricted. Restricted is a
          good choice for teams that manage things that need to be secure,
          like projects, branches, or PPAs.
