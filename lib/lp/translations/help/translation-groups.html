      <h2>Translation groups</h2>

      <p>
        Launchpad makes it easy for anyone to make or suggest translations for
        your project.
      </p>

      <p>
        Translation groups are a convenient way to delegate responsibility for
        reviewing the translations that people suggest for your project.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each translation group is an umbrella organisations &mdash; made up
        of <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Teams"
          target="_blank">teams</a> and individuals &mdash; that have taken
        responsibility for a particular language.</p>

      <p>
        When you choose a translation group, you're entrusting the review of
        your project's translations to its members. Each group has its own
        policies for standard vocabulary, how to handle plural forms and so
        on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unless your project is a member of an umbrella group that has its own
        translations group in Launchpad, or you have other specific needs, you
        should choose the <a
          href="https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/launchpad-translators"
          target="_blank">Launchpad Translators group</a>. (<a
          href="https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/LaunchpadTranslators"
          target="_blank">Read Launchpad Translators' policy &gt;</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        To choose an alternative group, <a
          href="https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups" target="_blank">
          browse the list of translation groups</a> in Launchpad. If you are
        certain none of the existing groups is suitable, <a
          href="https://answers.launchpad.net/rosetta/+addquestion"
          target="_blank">contact the Launchpad team</a>.
