"""Tests for visibility of private teams.

Private teams restrict the visibility of their attributes to select
sets of users in order to prevent leaking confidential data.

Private teams restrict the viewing of the membership list
to team administrators, other members of the team, and Launchpad
administrators. However, private teams may place themselves in a public role
by subscribing to bug, blueprints or branches, or being bug assignee etc.
In these cases, users who can view those artifacts are allowed to know of a
private team's existence, and basic properties like name, displayname etc, by
being granted launchpad.limitedView permission.
