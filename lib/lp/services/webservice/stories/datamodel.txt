End-to-end data model tests
***************************

The lazr.restful tests use in-memory Python objects, and Launchpad
uses Storm backed by a database. This means it's nice to have some
end-to-end tests of code paths that, on the surface, look like they're
already tested in lazr.restful.

    >>> def get_collection(version="devel", start=0, size=2):
    ...     collection = webservice.get(
    ...         ("/people?ws.op=find&text=s&ws.start=%s&ws.size=%s" %
    ...          (start, size)),
    ...         api_version=version)
    ...     return collection.jsonBody()


Normally, the total size of a collection is not served along with the
collection; it's available by following the total_size_link.

    >>> collection = get_collection()
    >>> for key in sorted(collection.keys()):
    ...     print(key)
    entries
    next_collection_link
    start
    total_size_link
    >>> print(webservice.get(collection['total_size_link']).jsonBody())
    9

If an entire collection fits on one page (making the size of the
collection obvious), 'total_size' is served instead of
'total_size_link'.

    >>> collection = get_collection(size=100)
    >>> for key in sorted(collection.keys()):
    ...     print(key)
    entries
    start
    total_size
    >>> print(collection['total_size'])
    9

If the last page of the collection is fetched (making the total size
of the collection semi-obvious), 'total_size' is served instead of
'total_size_link'.

    >>> collection = get_collection(start=8)
    >>> for key in sorted(collection.keys()):
    ...     print(key)
    entries
    prev_collection_link
    start
    total_size
    >>> print(collection['total_size'])
    9
