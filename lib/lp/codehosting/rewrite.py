        We use the 'translatePath' BranchFileSystemClient method.  There are

         (1) The request is for something within the .bzr directory of a
             branch.

             In this case we rewrite the request to the location from which
             branches are served by ID.

         (2) The request is for something within a branch, but not the .bzr
             directory.

             In this case, we hand the request off to codebrowse.

         (3) The branch is not found.  Two sub-cases: the request is for a
             product control directory or the we don't know how to translate
             the path.

             In both these cases we return 'NULL' which indicates to Apache
             that we don't know how to rewrite the request (and so it should
             go on to generate a 404 response).

        caller will catch and log them.
