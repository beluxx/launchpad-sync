    An `IBranchCollection` is an immutable collection of branches. It has two
    kinds of methods: filter methods and query methods.

    Query methods get information about the contents of collection. See
    `IBranchCollection.count` and `IBranchCollection.getBranches`.

    Filter methods return new IBranchCollection instances that have some sort
    of restriction. Examples include `ownedBy`, `visibleByUser` and
    `inProduct`.

    Implementations of this interface are not 'content classes'. That is, they

    This interface is intended for use within Launchpad, not to be exported as
    a public API.
