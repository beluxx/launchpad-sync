      <h2>What is karma?</h2>

      <p>
        Karma is one of the ways in which you can get a feel for the work
        that someone has done recently in Launchpad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Almost everything you do in Launchpad helps you to build karma. For
        example: registering bugs, translating strings and answering support
        requests. Different types of work earn different levels of karma.
        Also, the amount of karma a particular action gives you fades over
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Karma is only attributed for work done in Launchpad and does not
        apply to items imported from other sources.
