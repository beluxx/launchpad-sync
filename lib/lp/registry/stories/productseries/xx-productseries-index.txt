    The "trunk" series represents the primary line of
    development rather than a stable release branch. This is sometimes
    also called MAIN or HEAD.

Someone with edit permissions, such as the project owner or series driver
can see links to change the series. Sample person is the owner of the project,
and thus a member of the series drivers.

    >>> driver_browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic test@canonical.com:test")
    >>> driver_browser.open('http://launchpad.test/firefox/trunk')
    >>> driver_browser.getLink('Delete series')

    <Link ... url='http://launchpad.test/firefox/trunk/+subscribe'>

    <Link ... url='http://launchpad.test/firefox/trunk/+addmilestone'>

    >>> driver_browser.getLink('Create release')
    <Link ... url='http://launchpad.test/firefox/trunk/+addrelease'>

The user can learn where the code of the series is located if a branch
is set. Otherwise, there is a message explaining that the information has
not been set.

    >>> print(extract_text(find_tag_by_id(content, 'branch-details')))
