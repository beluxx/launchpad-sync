    A translation policy defines who can edit translations, and who can

    enter suggestions).  Everyone else is allowed only to view the
    translations.

    The policy can "invite" the user to edit or suggest; or it can
    merely "allow" them to.  Whoever is invited is also allowed, but
    administrators and certain other special users may be allowed
    without actually being invited.

    The invitation is based purely on the access model configured by the
