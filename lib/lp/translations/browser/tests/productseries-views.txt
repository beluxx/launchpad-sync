Set Up
======

We will have to check for a BranchJob being created for a branch, so
let's put this check in a convenient function.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.code.interfaces.branchjob import IRosettaUploadJobSource
    >>> job_counter = 0
    >>> def isUploadJobCreatedForBranch(productseries,
    ...                                 force_translations_upload=None):
    ...     global job_counter
    ...     ready_jobs = list(getUtility(IRosettaUploadJobSource).iterReady())
    ...     if len(ready_jobs) <= job_counter:
    ...         return False
    ...     job = ready_jobs[job_counter]
    ...     job_counter += 1
    ...     if force_translations_upload is None:
    ...         return productseries.branch == job.branch
    ...     return (productseries.branch == job.branch and
    ...            force_translations_upload == job.force_translations_upload)

Also, we need to set-up a branch for the product of this productseries. The
last_mirrored_id and the last_scanned_id is set to the same value to pretend
that the branch has been mirrored and scanned.

    >>> def makeScannedProductBranch(productseries):
    ...     branch = factory.makeProductBranch(productseries.product)
    ...     branch.last_mirrored_id = "some_rev_id"
    ...     branch.last_scanned_id = "some_rev_id"
    ...     return branch

For these tasks we need to log in.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')


ProductSeriesTranslationsSettingsView
=====================================

Special settings for translations of a ProductSeries are set through
this view.

The ProductSeries instance has a branch set that contains the source
code.

    >>> productseries = factory.makeProductSeries()
    >>> productseries.branch = makeScannedProductBranch(productseries)

    >>> from lp.translations.browser.productseries import (
    ...     ProductSeriesTranslationsSettingsView)

The only setting currently available is for the import of translation
templates from bazaar branches hosted on Launchpad.

    >>> from lp.services.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest()
    >>> view = ProductSeriesTranslationsSettingsView(
    ...     productseries, request)
    >>> view.setUpFields()
    >>> [field.__name__ for field in view.form_fields]
    ['translations_autoimport_mode']

This setting is represented by a SettingsRadioWidget which is derived
from LaunchpadRadioWidgetWithDescription.

    >>> view.setUpWidgets()
    >>> view.widgets['translations_autoimport_mode']
    <...SettingsRadioWidget object at...>

Submitting the form via "Change settings" will update the corresponding
attribute of the ProductSeries.

    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     method='POST',
    ...     form={'field.translations_autoimport_mode': 'IMPORT_TEMPLATES',
    ...           'field.actions.save_settings': 'Save Settings'})
    >>> view = ProductSeriesTranslationsSettingsView(
    ...     productseries, request)
    >>> print(productseries.translations_autoimport_mode.title)
    None
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> print(productseries.translations_autoimport_mode.title)
    Import template files

Also, a branch job to upload the full set of translation files has been
created to create the initial database entries from the files in the branch.

    >>> print(isUploadJobCreatedForBranch(productseries))
    True


ProductSeriesTranslationsBzrImportView
======================================

When requesting a one-time import of translation files, an Upload job
is created that has force_translations_upload set to true.

    >>> productseries = factory.makeProductSeries()
    >>> productseries.branch = makeScannedProductBranch(productseries)
    >>> from lp.translations.browser.productseries import (
    ...     ProductSeriesTranslationsBzrImportView)
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     method='POST',
    ...     form={'field.actions.request_import':
    ...               'Request one-time import'})
    >>> view = ProductSeriesTranslationsBzrImportView(
    ...     productseries, request)
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> print(isUploadJobCreatedForBranch(productseries, True))
    True
