"""The Launchpad code hosting file system.

The way Launchpad presents branches is very different from the way it stores
them. Externally, branches are reached using URLs that look like
<schema>://launchpad.net/~owner/product/branch-name. Internally, they are
stored by branch ID. Branch 1 is stored at 00/00/00/01 and branch 10 is stored
at 00/00/00/0A. Further, these branches might not be stored on the same
physical machine.

This means that our services need to translate the external paths into
internal paths.

We also want to let users create new branches on Launchpad simply by pushing
them up.

This means our services must detect events like 'make directory' and 'unlock
branch' and translate them into Launchpad operations like 'create branch' and
'request mirror' before performing those operations.

So, we have a `LaunchpadServer` which implements the core operations --
translate a path, make a branch and request a mirror -- in terms of virtual
paths.

This server does most of its work by querying an XML-RPC server that provides
the `IBranchFileSystem` interface and passing what that returns to a
`ITransportDispatch` object.

We hook the `LaunchpadServer` into Bazaar by implementing a
`AsyncVirtualTransport`, a `breezy.transport.Transport` that wraps all of its
operations so that they are translated by an object that implements
`translateVirtualPath`.  See transport.py for more information.

This virtual transport isn't quite enough, since it only does dumb path
translation. We also need to be able to interpret filesystem events in terms
of Launchpad branches. To do this, we provide a `LaunchpadTransport` that
hooks into operations like `mkdir` and ask the `LaunchpadServer` to make a
branch if appropriate.
