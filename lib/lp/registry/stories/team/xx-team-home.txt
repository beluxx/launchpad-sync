A team's home page
==================

The home page of a public team is visible to everyone.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~ubuntu-team')
    >>> print(browser.title)
    Ubuntu Team in Launchpad
    >>> privacy_info = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'privacy')
    >>> print(extract_text(privacy_info))

    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'contact-email')))
    Email:
    Log in for email information.

    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'contact-languages')))
    Languages:
    English

The polls portlet is only shown if current polls exist.

    >>> print(extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'polls')))

    A random poll that never closes...
    Show polls

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~launchpad')
    >>> print(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'polls'))
    None

The subteam-of portlet is not shown if the team is not a subteam.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~ubuntu-team')
    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'subteam-of')))
    Subteam of “Ubuntu Team” is a member of these teams: GuadaMen...

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~launchpad')
    >>> print(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'subteam-of'))
    None

Unless the user is the owner of the team and there are invitations to
join a team.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~launchpad')
    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(admin_browser.contents, 'subteam-of')))
    Subteam of...
    itself is not a member of any other team.
    Show received invitations

If the team does not have any recently approved, proposed, or invited
members, the empty lists are hidden using the "hidden" css class:

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~launchpad')
    >>> tag = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'recently-approved')
    >>> print(' '.join(tag['class']))
    hidden

    >>> tag = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'recently-proposed')
    >>> print(' '.join(tag['class']))
    hidden

    >>> tag = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'recently-invited')
    >>> print(' '.join(tag['class']))
    hidden

In the above case there's no user logged in, so it doesn't actually show
what's the user's involvement with the team. If the user logs in, they'll
see that, though.

    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'your-involvement')))
    You must log in to join or leave this team.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic foo.bar@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~guadamen')
    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'your-involvement')))
    You own this team...

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~rosetta-admins')
    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'your-involvement')))
    You indirectly own this team.
    You are not currently a member...

    >>> browser.getLink('Add member').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('New member').value = 'admins'
    >>> browser.getControl('Add Member').click()
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~rosetta-admins')
    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'your-involvement')))
    You indirectly own this team.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~ubuntu-team')
    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'your-involvement')))
    You are a member of this team...

Member can contact their team even if the team does not have a contact
address:

    >>> sample_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> sample_browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~landscape-developers')
    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(sample_browser.contents, 'contact-email')))
    Email:
    None, members emailed directly
    Set contact address
    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(sample_browser.contents, 'contact-user')))
    Contact this team's members

As teams do not have OpenID Logins, there is no link in the Contact
details section for help.

    >>> sample_browser.getLink('OpenID help')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
    zope.testbrowser.browser.LinkNotFoundError

If the logged in user is an indirect member of the team, we'll say that and
will even show the path from the user to the team.

    >>> sample_browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~name18')
    >>> print(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(sample_browser.contents, 'your-involvement')))
    You are an indirect member of this team:
    Sample Person → Warty Security Team → Ubuntu Gnome Team...

It is also possible to view the set of mugshots of the people in the
team.  Notice that the output of mugshots is batched.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~ubuntu-team/')
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Show member photos').click()
    >>> main_content = find_main_content(anon_browser.contents)
    >>> print(main_content)
    <...
    <h1>Member photos</h1>
    ...
    1...10... of 10 results
