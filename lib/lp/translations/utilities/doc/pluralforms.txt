Plural forms helpers
====================

The pluralforms.py is a helper file, that contains several methods.


make_friendly_plural_forms
--------------------------

The make_friendly_plural_forms method creates a list of dicts, each one
containing a plural form number and a list of examples for this plural form.
It uses as input the plural forms expression for the language, C-like, and
the number of plural forms for the considered language.

    >>> from lp.translations.utilities.pluralforms import (
    ...     make_friendly_plural_forms)

Let's use a Serbian language as example. Here's the plural forms
expression for Serbian:

    >>> expression = (
    ...     'n%10==1 && n%100!=11 ? 0 : '
    ...     'n%10>=2 && n%10<=4 && (n%100<10 || n%100>=20) ? 1 : 2')

It's also known that Serbian has 3 plural forms.

    >>> pluralforms_count = 3

    >>> friendly_plural_forms = make_friendly_plural_forms(
    ...     expression, pluralforms_count)

    >>> for form_dict in friendly_plural_forms:
    ...     print(form_dict['form'], ":", form_dict['examples'])
    0 : [1, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61]
    1 : [2, 3, 4, 22, 23, 24]
    2 : [0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
