Nearby Branches
===============

At the bottom of the main branch page there are links to other related
branches.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> eric = factory.makePerson(name='eric')
    >>> vikings = factory.makeTeam(owner=eric, name='vikings')
    >>> fooix = factory.makeProduct(name='fooix')
    >>> branch = factory.makeProductBranch(
    ...     product=fooix, owner=vikings, registrant=eric)
    >>> url = canonical_url(branch)
    >>> logout()

    >>> browser.open(url)

Since the links point to the code subdomain, the links are relative to the
root.

    >>> div = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'nearby-branches')
    >>> for anchor in div.find_all('a'):
    ...     print(anchor['href'], anchor.string)
    /fooix                      Other Fooix branches
