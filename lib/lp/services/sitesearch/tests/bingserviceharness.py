    # bing-service-stub.rst, is also disabled.  See test_doc.py.

    The fixture can be started and stopped multiple time in succession:

    >>> BingServiceTestSetup().setUp()
    >>> assert service_is_available()

    Having a service instance already running doesn't prevent a new
    service from starting.  The old instance is killed off and replaced
    by the new one.
