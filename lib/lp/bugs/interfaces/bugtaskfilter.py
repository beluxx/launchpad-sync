    The context is used to return the most relevant bugtask for that context.

    An initial constraint is to not require any database queries from this
    method.

    Current contexts that impact selection:
      IProduct
      IProductSeries
      IDistribution
      IDistroSeries
      ISourcePackage
    Others:
      get the first bugtask for any particular bug

    If the context is a Product, then return the product bug task if there is
    one.  If the context is a ProductSeries, then return the productseries
    task if there is one, and if there isn't, look for the product task.  A
    similar approach is taked for Distribution and distroseries.

    For source packages, we look for the source package task, followed by the
    distro source package, then the distroseries task, and lastly the distro
    task.

    If there is no specific matching task, we return the first task (the one
    with the smallest database id).
