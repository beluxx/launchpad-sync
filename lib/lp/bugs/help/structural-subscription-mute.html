      <p>
        Sometimes you will have bug subscriptions via a team and you no longer
        want to receive the emails. If so, you can disable the delivery of the
        messages to yourself without affecting the other team members.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if a team delivers its bug messages via a mailing list or
        some other preferred email, disabling email delivery will not be
        honored because doing so would prevent the other team members from
        receiving the notifications.
