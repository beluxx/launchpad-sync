Some files in this directory are PGP-signed

See `lp/testing/gpgkeys/data/README` for more information about the keys being used.

To sign a file you should

1. Import the key:

```
gpg --import lib/lp/testing/gpgkeys/data/foo.bar@canonical.com.pub
gpg --import lib/lp/testing/gpgkeys/data/foo.bar@canonical.com.sec
```

2. Add a signature like so:

```
gpg --clearsign -u foo.bar@canonical.com PATH_TO_THE_FILE
```
