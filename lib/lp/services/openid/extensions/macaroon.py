"""Support for issuing discharge macaroons via the OpenID request.

RPs may need to use SSO authority to authorise macaroons issued by other
services.  The simplest way to do this securely as part of a browser
workflow is to piggyback on the OpenID interaction: this makes it
straightforward to request login information if necessary and gives us
CSRF-safe data exchange.

As part of an OpenID authentication request, the RP includes the following
fields:

  openid.ns.macaroon:
    An OpenID 2.0 namespace URI for the extension. It is not strictly
    required for 1.1 requests, but including it is good for forward
    compatibility.

    It must be set to: http://ns.login.ubuntu.com/2016/openid-macaroon

  openid.macaroon.caveat_id
    The SSO third-party caveat ID from the root macaroon that the RP wants
    to discharge.

As part of the positive assertion OpenID response, the following fields
will be provided:

  openid.ns.macaroon:
    (as above)

  openid.macaroon.discharge
    A serialised discharge macaroon for the provided root macaroon.
