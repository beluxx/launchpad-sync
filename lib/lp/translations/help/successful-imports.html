      <h2>Importing translation files from a Bazaar branch</h2>

      <p>
        When importing translation files into Launchpad from a tarball or
        a Bazaar branch, you must follow our <a
          href="https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/YourProject/ImportPolicy"
          target="_blank">translations import policy</a>. At a minimum, your
        tarball or branch must:
      </p>

      <ul class="bulleted">
        <li>Contain at least one <code>.pot</code> file with English strings,
          rather than message IDs or another language. You cannot upload a
          <code>.po</code> file on its own.</li>
        <li>Give each template its own directory (<a
            href="/+help-translations/directory-example.html">see an example
            directory layout</a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The first time you upload a template, it'll usually take a few days
        before it is approved. However, imports from Bazaar branches are
        usually approved sooner than imports from tarballs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Subsequent updates to templates, and <code>.po</code> files will be
        approved automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following approval, the English strings, and any translations, will be
        available in Launchpad within one day and usually much sooner.
