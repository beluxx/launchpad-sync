  Launchpad is an open source suite of tools that help people and teams
  to work together on software projects.

  This charm runs a Launchpad PPA publisher. Takes all PPAs that are pending
  in the database (added there by a launchpad-ppa-uploader unit) and arranges
  for contents of the disk to match.
