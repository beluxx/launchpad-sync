      <h2>Staging &mdash; Launchpad's sandbox</h2>

      <p>
        If you want to try Launchpad out, you can use the staging environment
        (at <a href="https://staging.launchpad.net/"
          target="parent">https://staging.launchpad.net/</a>) to experiment
        with real data and functionality, but without affecting the day-to-day
        work of other Launchpad users.
      </p>

      <p>However, there are a few things to note about staging:</p>

      <ul class="bulleted">
        <li>Every week, staging's database is replaced with a fresh snapshot
          of Launchpad's production database: you
          will lose anything you do on staging.</li>
        <li>Staging runs the latest code with changed database models from the
          Launchpad developers &mdash; if things go wrong, <a target="_blank"
            href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+filebug">please let us
            know</a>.</li>
        <li>You can't create a new account on staging &mdash; instead, create
          one in <a href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad's production
            environment</a> and then wait up to 24 hours for your account to
          be available on staging.</li>
        <li>Staging does not send email.</li>
        <li>You can upload translations and templates but not export them
          &mdash; uploaded translations/templates will disappear after 24
          hours.</li>
        <li>To push code branches to staging you need use
          <code>bzr push lp://staging/~your-id/branch-name</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
