      <h2>Switching between "translator" and "reviewer" modes</h2>

      <p>
        If you're making translations for a project that uses a
        <em>Structured</em> or <em>Restricted</em>
        <a href="/+help-translations/permissions-policies.html">permissions
          policy</a> <strong>and</strong> you're a member of the appropriate
        <a href="/+help-translations/translation-groups.html">translation
          team</a> you can work in one of two modes:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Reviewer:</dt>
        <dd>
          This is the default working mode. All
          changes you make are approved automatically. If you want to make a
          suggestion, rather than a new translation, you need to manually
          select
          the <em>Someone should to review this translation</em> check-box.
        </dd>
        <dt>Translator:</dt>
        <dd>
          When entering new translations, they're
          treated as suggestions that someone else needs to review. You can
          make
          a direct translation by deselecting the <em>Someone should to review
            this translation</em> check-box.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>How this affects team workflows</h2>

      <p>
        When you're reviewing translations made by other people, or you're
        working in a small team, you usually want your translations to be
        applied automatically. This is when you'd choose <em>Reviewer</em>
        mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if you're working in a team that uses a peer review process
        <em>Translator</em> mode will be more suitable as it holds each of
        your translations as suggestions that should be reviewed by someone
        else.
