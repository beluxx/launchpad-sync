  Go to a condorcet-style poll (which is still open) and check that apart
  from seeing our vote we can also change it.

    view or change your vote you must enter your key:...

  If a non-member (Sample Person) guesses the voting URL and tries to vote,
  they won't be allowed.

  By providing the token we will be able to see our current vote.

  It's also possible to change the vote, if wanted.

  Now we go to another poll in which name16 voted. But this time it's a public
  one, so there's no need to provide the token to see the current vote.

    >>> print(http(r"""
    ... GET /~ubuntu-team/+poll/never-closes3 HTTP/1.1

    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    ...
                    <p>Your current vote is as follows:</p>
                    <p>
    <BLANKLINE>
                        <b>1</b>.
                        Option 1
    <BLANKLINE>
                    </p>
                    <p>
    <BLANKLINE>
                        <b>2</b>.
                        Option 2
    <BLANKLINE>
                    </p>
                    <p>
    <BLANKLINE>
                        <b>3</b>.
                        Option 3
    <BLANKLINE>
                    </p>
                    <p>

    <BLANKLINE>

  Now we change the vote and we see the new vote displayed as our current
  vote.

  Logged in as mark@example.com (which is a member of ubuntu-team), go to a
  public condorcet-style poll that's still open and get redirected to a page
  where it's possible to vote (and see the current vote).

    >>> print(http(r"""
    ... GET /~ubuntu-team/+poll/never-closes3 HTTP/1.1
    ... Authorization: Basic mark@example.com:test
    ... """))
    HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
    ...
    Location: http://localhost/~ubuntu-team/+poll/never-closes3/+vote

  And here we'll see the form which says you haven't voted yet and allows you
  to vote.

    >>> print(http(r"""
    ... GET /~ubuntu-team/+poll/never-closes3/+vote HTTP/1.1

    ...
    ...Your current vote...
