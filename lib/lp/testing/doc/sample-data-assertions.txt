Sample Data Assertions
======================

This set of doctests makes a set of assertions about the sample data we have
in the Launchpad application. This is designed to prevent people from
changing sample data in ways that will cause unexpected failures in
pagetests elsewhere.

After you add sample data to Launchpad, or modify existing data, you should
AT LEAST run this test to see that you haven't broken any assumptions.

User Accounts and Teams
-----------------------

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
  >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)

Here we make assertions about each of the key user accounts which should be
used in Launchpad page tests. These should be the ONLY user accounts
specifically referenced in Launchpad tests.

* No Team Memberships
  This user is not supposed to be a member of any teams.

  >>> no_team_memberships = personset.getByName('no-team-memberships')
  >>> no_team_memberships.team_memberships.count()
  0

* One Team Membership
  This user is supposed to be a member of only one team, the "Simple Team".

  >>> one_membership = personset.getByName('one-membership')
  >>> for t in one_membership.team_memberships: print(t.team.displayname)
  Simple Team
