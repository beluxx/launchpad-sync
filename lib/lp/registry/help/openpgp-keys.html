      <h2>Introducing OpenPGP keys</h2>

      <p>
        An OpenPGP (also called GnuPrivacyGuard) key allows you to sign
        documents, such as emails or text files, using a digital key.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two parts to an OpenPGP key: one public that you share with
        the world and the other private, which you should guard closely. Both
        are standard text files that make up a digital signature.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Launchpad, you can use your OpenPGP key to identify yourself when
        using the bug tracker's email interface, when uploading distribution
        packages and when signing a code of conduct.
      </p>

      <h3>Generating your key in Ubuntu</h3>

      <p>
        The easiest way to generate a new OpenPGP key in Ubuntu is to use the
        <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em> tool. If you are using Ubuntu
        10.04 or an earlier version, it is located at <em>Applications &gt;
          Accessories &gt; Passwords and Encryption Keys</em>. In Ubuntu 10.10
        and later versions, it is located at <em>System &gt; Preferences &gt;
          Passwords and Encryption Keys</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 1</strong> open <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 2</strong> Select <em>File &gt; New</em>, select <em>PGP
          Key</em> and then follow the on-screen
        instructions.
      </p>

      <p>Now you'll see your new key listed in the
        <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em> tool.
      </p>

      <a name="publish"></a>
      <h3>Publishing your key</h3>

      <p>Your key is useful only if other people can verify items that you
        sign. By publishing your key to a keyserver, which acts as a directory
        of people's public keys, you can make your public key available to
        anyone else.</p>

      <p>Before you add your key to Launchpad, you need to push it to the Ubuntu
      keyserver. (If the import fails, it is worth trying to import it to the
      global keyserver as well.)</p>

      <h4>Using <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em></h4>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 1</strong> Open <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 2</strong> Select the <em>My Personal Keys</em> tab,
        select your key.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 3</strong> Select <em>Remote &gt; Sync and Publish
          Keys</em> from the menu. Choose the <em>Sync</em> button. (You may
        need to add hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com to your key servers if you are
        not using Ubuntu.)
      </p>

      <p>
        It can take up to thirty minutes before your key is available to
        Launchpad. After that time, you're ready to
        <a href="/+help-registry/import-pgp-key.html">import your new key into
          Launchpad</a>!
      </p>

      <p>
        Make sure the email address you used to generate your key with is the
        same as the one that is registered with Launchpad.
      </p>

      <h3>Renewing your key</h3>

      <p>
        You may have set your key to expire. You can update your key and
        republish it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 1</strong> Open <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 2</strong> Select the <em>My Personal Keys</em> tab,
        select your key, and open the property window by pressing Space Bar
        our double clicking with your pointer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 3</strong> Set a new expiration date or choose never.
      </p>

      <p>
        See the <em>Publishing your key</em> section above.
      </p>
