Launchpad pages end with a comment that displays how many actions outside of
the regular python code we've issued to satisfy the request. Note that we say "at
least" because unfortunately some queries may be issued after the page may
finish rendering -- the authoritative source is in OOPS reports or in the web
app's stderr.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.test/')
    >>> print(browser.contents)
    <!DOCTYPE...
    ...<!--... At least ... actions issued in ... seconds ...-->...

It's available for any page:

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.test/~mark/')
    >>> print(browser.contents)
    <!DOCTYPE...
    ...<!--... At least ... actions issued in ... seconds ...-->...
