      <h2>Reviewing translations</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> You can find the translation guidelines
        you must follow as a reviewer by visiting the appropriate
        translation group from the <a href="/+groups/" target="_blank">
          translation group overview page</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a member of one or more translation teams, you can help make
        sure that that the work of other translators makes it into
        published software.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the quickest ways is to review translated strings in the
        languages with which you're familiar. The more reviews you do, the
        more software will be available in the languages you care about.
      </p>

      <p>
        To get started, simply follow the review links on your <a
          href="https://translations.launchpad.net/people/+me/"
          target="_blank"> translation dashboard</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> there's a lot more to being a member of
        a translation team than just reviewing strings. Most translation
        teams have an active community that works to set standards and
        divide up work among its members.
