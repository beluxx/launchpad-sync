Launchpad developer documentation
=================================

Welcome to the Launchpad developer documentation.  This documentation is for
people who want to hack on Launchpad.

Launchpad is an open source suite of tools that help people and teams to
work together on software projects.  Unlike many open source projects,
Launchpad isn't something you install and run yourself (although you are
welcome to do so), instead, contributors help make `Launchpad
<https://launchpad.net>`_ better.

If you want help using Launchpad, then please visit our `user documentation
<https://help.launchpad.net>`_.

If you'd like to contribute to Launchpad, this documentation is for you.
Alternatively, :doc:`have a poke around in the code <how-to/running>`.
