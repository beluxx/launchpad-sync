      <h2>How do I use software from a PPA?</h2>

      <p>
        To start installing and using software from a Personal Package
        Archive, you first need to tell Ubuntu where to find the PPA.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> The contents of Personal Package Archives
        are not checked or monitored. You install software from them at your
        own risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're using the most recent version of Ubuntu (or any version from
        Ubuntu 9.10 onwards), you can add a PPA to your system with a single
        line in your terminal.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> On the PPA's overview page, look for the
        heading that reads <em>Adding this PPA to your system</em>. Make a
        note of the PPA's location, which looks like:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Open a terminal and enter:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/ppa-name</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        Replace <code>ppa:user/ppa-name</code> with the PPA's location that
        you noted above.
      </p>

        alt="Screen shot of a terminal with the sudo add-apt-repository line"
        style="margin-bottom: 15px;" />

      <p>
        Your system will now fetch the PPA's key. This enables your Ubuntu
        system to verify that the packages in the PPA have not been interfered
        with since they were built.
      </p>

      <img src="images/add-apt-repo2.png"
        alt="Screen shot of a system retrieving the PPA details"
        style="margin-bottom: 15px;" />

      <p>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, as a one-off, you should tell your
        system to pull down the latest list of software from each archive it
        knows about, including the PPA you just added:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>sudo apt update</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now you're ready to start installing software from the PPA!
