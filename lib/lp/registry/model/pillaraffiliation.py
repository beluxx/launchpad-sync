"""Adapters to figure out affiliations between people and pillars/bugs etc.

When using a person in a given context, for example as a selection item in a
picker used to choose a bug task assignee, it is important to provide an
indication as to how that person may be affiliated with the context. Amongst
other reasons, this provides a visual cue that the correct person is being
selected for example.

The adapters herein are provided for various contexts so that for a given
person, the relevant affiliation details may be determined.
