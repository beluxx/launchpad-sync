Serving directories of files
============================

LAZR adds special views that can be used to serve all the files under a
particular directory.

ExportedFolder
--------------

This is the base implementation. To export a directory, you need to
subclass that view and provide a folder property returning the path of
the directory to expose.

    >>> import os
    >>> import tempfile
    >>> resource_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix='resources')
    >>> with open(os.path.join(resource_dir, 'test.txt'), 'w') as f:
    ...     _ = f.write('Text file')
    >>> with open(os.path.join(resource_dir, 'image1.gif'), 'w') as f:
    ...     _ = f.write('GIF file')
    >>> with open(os.path.join(resource_dir, 'image2.png'), 'w') as f:
    ...     _ = f.write('PNG file')
    >>> os.mkdir(os.path.join(resource_dir, 'a_dir'))
    >>> with open(os.path.join(resource_dir, 'other.txt'), 'w') as f:
    ...     _ = f.write('Other file')

    >>> from lp.app.browser.folder import ExportedFolder
    >>> class MyFolder(ExportedFolder):
    ...     folder = resource_dir

That view provides the IBrowserPublisher interface necessary to handle
all the traversal logic.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from zope.publisher.interfaces.browser import IBrowserPublisher
    >>> from lazr.restful.testing.webservice import FakeRequest

    >>> view = MyFolder(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> verifyObject(IBrowserPublisher, view)
    True

The view will serve the file that it traverses to.

    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'test.txt')
    >>> print(view().decode('UTF-8'))
    Text file

It also sets the appropriate headers for cache control on the response.

    >>> for name in sorted(view.request.response.headers):
    ...     print("%s: %s" % (name, view.request.response.getHeader(name)))
    Cache-Control: public...
    Content-Type: text/plain
    Expires: ...
    Last-Modified: ...

It accepts traversing to the file through an arbitrary revision
identifier.

    >>> view = MyFolder(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'rev6510')
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'image1.gif')
    >>> print(view().decode('UTF-8'))
    GIF file

Requesting a directory raises a NotFound.

    >>> view = MyFolder(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'a_dir')
    >>> view()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    zope.publisher.interfaces.NotFound: ...

By default, subdirectories are not exported. (See below on how to enable
this)

    >>> view = MyFolder(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'a_dir')
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'other.txt')
    >>> view()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    zope.publisher.interfaces.NotFound: ...

Not requesting any file, also raises NotFound.

    >>> view = MyFolder(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    zope.publisher.interfaces.NotFound: ...

As requesting a non-existent file.

    >>> view = MyFolder(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'image2')
    >>> view()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    zope.publisher.interfaces.NotFound: ...


ExportedImageFolder
-------------------

For images, it's often convenient not to request the extension. There is
an ExportedImageFolder subclass, that will accept serving an image file
without extension.  For example, requesting 'image1' or 'image2' will
serve the correct file. The supported extensions are defined in the
image_extensions property.

    >>> from lp.app.browser.folder import ExportedImageFolder

    >>> class MyImageFolder(ExportedImageFolder):
    ...     folder = resource_dir

    >>> view = MyImageFolder(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view.image_extensions
    ('.png', '.gif')

    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'image2')
    >>> print(view().decode('UTF-8'))
    PNG file
    >>> print(view.request.response.getHeader('Content-Type'))
    image/png

If a file without extension exists, that one will be served.

    >>> with open(os.path.join(resource_dir, 'image3'), 'w') as f:
    ...     _ = f.write('Image without extension')
    >>> with open(os.path.join(resource_dir, 'image3.gif'), 'w') as f:
    ...     _ = f.write('Image with extension')

    >>> view = MyImageFolder(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'image3')
    >>> print(view().decode('UTF-8'))
    Image without extension

    >>> view = MyImageFolder(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'image3.gif')
    >>> print(view().decode('UTF-8'))
    Image with extension


Exporting trees
---------------

By default ExportedFolder doesn't export contained folders, but if the
export_subdirectories is set to True, it will allow traversing to
subdirectories.

    >>> os.mkdir(os.path.join(resource_dir, 'public'))
    >>> with open(os.path.join(
    ...         resource_dir, 'public', 'test1.txt'), 'w') as f:
    ...     _ = f.write('Public File')
    >>> os.mkdir(os.path.join(resource_dir, 'public', 'subdir1'))
    >>> with open(os.path.join(
    ...         resource_dir, 'public', 'subdir1', 'test1.txt'), 'w') as f:
    ...     _ = f.write('Sub file 1')

    >>> class MyTree(ExportedFolder):
    ...     folder = resource_dir
    ...     export_subdirectories = True

Traversing to a file in a subdirectory will now work.

    >>> view = MyTree(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'public')
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'subdir1')
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'test1.txt')
    >>> print(view().decode('UTF-8'))
    Sub file 1

But traversing to the subdirectory itself will raise a NotFound.

    >>> view = MyTree(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'public')
    >>> view()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    zope.publisher.interfaces.NotFound: ...

Trying to request a non-existent file, will also raise a NotFound.

    >>> view = MyTree(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'public')
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'nosuchfile.txt')
    >>> view()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    zope.publisher.interfaces.NotFound: ...

Traversing beyond an existing file to a non-existant file raises a
NotFound.

    >>> view = MyTree(object(), FakeRequest(version="devel"))
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'public')
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'subdir1')
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'test1.txt')
    >>> view = view.publishTraverse(view.request, 'nosuchpath')
    >>> view()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    zope.publisher.interfaces.NotFound: ...


Clean-up
--------

    >>> import shutil
    >>> shutil.rmtree(resource_dir)
