      <h2>Tips for new translators</h2>

      <p>
        If you're new to translating using Launchpad, there are a few things
        you might find it useful to know.
      </p>

      <ul class="bulleted">
        <li>
          You can <a href="/people/+me/+editlanguages" target="_blank">tell
            Launchpad which languages you prefer to work in</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can help any of hundreds of projects that use Launchpad to
          translate their software. Also, you can help translate
          distributions, such as Ubuntu.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each project/distribution decides how to balance openness with the
          need for review of translations by selecting a <a
            href="/+help-translations/permissions-policies.html">permissions
            policy</a>. For most projects, you'll be able to suggest
          translations that will then be reviewed by someone else.
        </li>
      </ul>
