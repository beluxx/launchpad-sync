Patches View
============

Patches View by Bug Target
--------------------------

We have a view listing patches attached to bugs that target a given
bug target (in this case, a product).  At first, the product is new
and has no bugs.

    >>> from lp.testing import anonymous_logged_in, with_person_logged_in
    >>> with anonymous_logged_in():
    ...     anybody = factory.makePerson()
    >>> with_anybody = with_person_logged_in(anybody)
    >>> patchy_product = with_anybody(factory.makeProduct)(
    ...     name='patchy-product-1', displayname="Patchy 1", title="Patchy 1")
    >>> transaction.commit()

We don't see any patches when we open the patches view.

    >>> def show_patches_view(contents):
    ...     for tag in find_tags_by_class(contents, 'listing'):
    ...         print(extract_text(tag))
    ...     messages = find_tags_by_class(contents, 'informational')
    ...     if len(messages) > 0:
    ...         print(extract_text(messages[0]))

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.test/patchy-product-1/+patches')
    >>> show_patches_view(anon_browser.contents)
    There are no patches associated with Patchy 1 at this time.

After the product has a bug, it still doesn't show up in the patches
view, because that bug has no patch attachments.

    >>> from lp.bugs.interfaces.bugtask import (
    ...     BugTaskImportance, BugTaskStatus)
    >>> @with_anybody
    ... def make_bug(
    ...     title, product, importance=BugTaskImportance.UNDECIDED,
    ...     status=BugTaskStatus.NEW):
    ...     bug = factory.makeBug(title=title, target=product)
    ...     transaction.commit()
    ...     bug.default_bugtask.transitionToImportance(
    ...         importance, product.owner)
    ...     bug.default_bugtask.transitionToStatus(
    ...         status, product.owner)
    ...     transaction.commit()
    ...     return bug

    >>> bug_a = make_bug(title="bug_a title", product=patchy_product)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.test/patchy-product-1/+patches')
    >>> show_patches_view(anon_browser.contents)
    There are no patches associated with Patchy 1 at this time.

After we add a non-patch attachment to that bug, the patches view
still shows no patches.

    >>> with_anybody(factory.makeBugAttachment)(bug=bug_a, is_patch=False)
    <lp.bugs.model.bugattachment.BugAttachment object at...
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.test/patchy-product-1/+patches')
    >>> show_patches_view(anon_browser.contents)
    There are no patches associated with Patchy 1 at this time.

After we add a patch attachment that's one day old, we see it in the
patches view.

    >>> patch_submitter = with_anybody(factory.makePerson)(
    ...    name="patchy-person", displayname="Patchy Person")
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> with_anybody(factory.makeBugAttachment)(
    ...     comment="comment about patch a",
    ...     filename="patch_a.diff", owner=patch_submitter,
    ...     description="description of patch a", bug=bug_a, is_patch=True)
    <lp.bugs.model.bugattachment.BugAttachment object at...
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.test/patchy-product-1/+patches')
    >>> show_patches_view(anon_browser.contents)
    Bug                                 Importance   Status    Patch Age

The page title and other wording in the page reflects the contents.

    >>> print_location(anon_browser.contents)
    Hierarchy: Patchy 1
    Tabs: ...
    Main heading: Patch attachments

After creating some more bugs, with some non-patch and some patch
attachments, and various statuses...

    >>> bug_b = make_bug(
    ...     title="bug_b title", product=patchy_product,
    ...     importance=BugTaskImportance.CRITICAL,
    ...     status=BugTaskStatus.CONFIRMED)
    >>> bug_c = make_bug(

    >>> transaction.commit()

...the youngest patch on each bug is visible in the patch report
(except for bugs in "Fix Released" state, which aren't shown):

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.test/patchy-product-1/+patches')
    >>> show_patches_view(anon_browser.contents)
    Bug                                 Importance   Status    Patch Age

The default sort order is by patch age. We can sort patches by
importance and status.

    >>> anon_browser.getControl(name="orderby").value = ['-importance']
    >>> anon_browser.getControl("sort").click()
    >>> anon_browser.url
    'http://bugs.launchpad.test/patchy-product-1/+patches?orderby=-importance'
    >>> show_patches_view(anon_browser.contents)
    Bug                                 Importance   Status    Patch Age

    >>> show_patches_view(anon_browser.contents)
    Bug                                 Importance   Status    Patch Age

    Bug #...: bug_c title               Wishlist  Fix Committed ...second...

But we can't sort by things that aren't validated by the view.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.test/patchy-product-1/+patches'
    ...     '?orderby=star-sign')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    lp.app.errors.UnexpectedFormData:
    Unexpected value for field 'orderby': 'star-sign'


Bugs in a product series show up in the patches view for that series.
