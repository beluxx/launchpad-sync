# This module has been chosen to be the example for how to implement a new
# feed class.  While the two interfaces `IFeed` and `IFeedEntry` are heavily
# documented, additional documentation has been added to this module to
# clearly demonstrate the concepts required to implement a feed rather than
# simply referencing the interfaces.
