  description: |
    Stop the launchpad-bzr-sftp service.  Usually run in preparation
    for maintenance.  (Note that this does not stop services in a way that
    will persist across a reboot.  It also doesn't disable cron jobs, since
    those are handled by the cron-control mechanism instead; see
    lp.services.scripts.base.cronscript_enabled.)
