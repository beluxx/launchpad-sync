      <h2>Why do I need a "Subscription name"?</h2>

      <p>
        You may have more than one structural subscription per project, each
        with different criteria. You may provide a name in order to identify
        them in the future in order to edit or delete them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, each email generated by this subscription will quote the name
        you choose, both in the email body and as a header
        (<code>X-Launchpad-Subscription</code>), making it easy to filter
        your bug mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, please provide a short, descriptive name to help you remember this
        subscription.
