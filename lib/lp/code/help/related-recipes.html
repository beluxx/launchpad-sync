      <p>
        You can ask Launchpad to make an automatic daily build
        of the code in this branch and place the resultant package(s)
        in your chosen PPA. (<a

      </p>

      <p>A "recipe" is a description of the steps Launchpad's package builder
        should take to construct a source package from a set of Bazaar or Git
        branches that you specify.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using a recipe, you tell Launchpad:
      </p>
      <ul class="bulleted">
        <li>in which branch to find the code</li>
        <li>where to find the packaging information &mdash; e.g. in a separate
          branch or in an existing Ubuntu package branch</li>
        <li>the correct package version (so users will still be able to
          upgrade
          to the stable version of the distro once it gets released)</li>
        <li>any modifications necessary to make the source build properly</li>
      </ul>
