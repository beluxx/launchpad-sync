This is the Launchpad Badge Kit.  It is meant to be displayed by
projects that use Launchpad.net, on their home pages.

The home page for the badge kit itself lives in the help.launchpad.net
(tentatively at https://help.launchpad.net/BadgeKit, although if that
changes, no one is likely to remember to update this README, so be
aware that this might already be obsolete).  The images themselves
should be hosted on media.launchpad.net, since we will encourage
people to include our images rather than self-host them -- that way if
we ever improve the images, most users will be upgraded automatically.

The file sample-index.html is merely a proposed way to present the
images, to be used internally while the wiki page is being built.  It
can probably go away after the Badge Kit is released.
