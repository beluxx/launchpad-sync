      <h2>Translation permission policies</h2>

      <p>
        Each project and distribution can choose what they feel to be the
        right mix of openness and control for their translations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Launchpad offers four permission policies:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Open:</dt>
        <dd>Anyone can submit translations directly to your project in
          Launchpad. Great for encouraging drive-by contributions.</dd>
        <dt>Structured:</dt>
        <dd>If your project's translation group has assigned an individual or
          team to a particular language, only that person or members of that
          team can review and accept translation strings for that language.
          Anyone can suggest a translation for those languages, though. For
          languages that aren't covered by a translation group, anyone can
          directly submit a translation.</dd>
        <dt>Restricted:</dt>
        <dd>Ideal if your priority is to manage translation quality, or if
          translation to some languages is managed elsewhere. It is similar to
          Structured. However, the ability to translate is unavailable for
          those languages that don't have an individual or team assigned to it
          within the translation group.</dd>
        <dt>Closed:</dt>
        <dd>Only people or teams appointed in the translation group can
          suggest or make translations. Translation is closed to everyone
          else. This is ideal if your project requires an agreement to
          transfer copyright before starting work.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        Make your translations count! Unless you're just making a quick
        correction, you should get in touch with the project's translation
        community before you start work. That way you can learn where your
        help is most needed, what words they use to translate common terms and
        what gives your translations the best chance of being approved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow the link to the project's translations group to contact them.
