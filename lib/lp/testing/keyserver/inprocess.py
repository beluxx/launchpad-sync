    """A fixture that runs an in-process key server.

    This is much faster than the out-of-process `KeyServerTac`, but it can
    only be used if all the tests relying on it are asynchronous.

    Users of this fixture must call the `start` method, which returns a
    `Deferred`, and arrange for that to get back to the reactor.  This is
    necessary because the basic fixture API does not allow `setUp` to return
    anything.  For example:

        class TestSomething(TestCase):

            run_tests_with = AsynchronousDeferredRunTest.make_factory(
                timeout=30)

            def setUp(self):
                super(TestSomething, self).setUp()
                yield self.useFixture(InProcessKeyServerFixture()).start()

    Unlike other fixtures, `InProcessKeyServerFixture` should not be used as
    a context manager, because the context manager API does not offer a way
    to do asynchronous cleanup.
