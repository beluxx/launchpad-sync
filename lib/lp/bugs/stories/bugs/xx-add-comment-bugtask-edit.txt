Add a comment while editing the bugtask
=======================================

When editing a bug task it's possible to add a comment as well. It's not
necessary to actually edit the bug task in order to add the comment,
though. Sometimes you start editing the task, and write a comment there,
but then change your mind and revert the bug task edit. In this case the
comment should be accepted anyway. There should be no need for copying
the comment to another comment field.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.test/firefox/+bug/1/+editstatus')
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Comment').value = (
    ...     'A comment with no change to the bug task.')
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Save Changes').click()

The user was returned to the bug page, and the comment was added.

    >>> user_browser.url
    'http://bugs.launchpad.test/firefox/+bug/1'

    >>> main_content = find_main_content(user_browser.contents)
    >>> last_comment = main_content('div', 'boardCommentBody')[-1]
    >>> print(last_comment.div.decode_contents())
    <div...><p>A comment with no change to the bug task.</p></div>
