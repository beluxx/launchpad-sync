    different lists are approved, they get their personal standing bumped from
    Unknown to Good.  This will allow them to post to mailing lists they are
    not a member of with no future holds on their messages.

    Note however that it takes approved posts to three different lists to bump
    standing.  Also, standing will only ever transition from Unknown to Good.
    If their current personal standing is not Unknown, nothing will change.
