      <h2>Uploading a branch without registering</h2>

      <p>If you want to host a Bazaar branch on Launchpad, you can push it
        straight to Launchpad without first registering.</p>

      <p>Simply open up your terminal, change to the directory that contains
        your Bazaar branch and type:</p>

      <p>
        <code>
         bzr launchpad-login userid<br/>
         bzr push lp:~userid/project-name/branch-name
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>Replace <em>userid</em> with your Launchpad id, <em>project-name</em>
        with the project's Launchpad id and then chose whichever branch name
        you want.</p>

      <h3>If you register the branch in Launchpad before pushing to it</h3>

      <p>If you register the branch in Launchpad's web interface, before
        pushing anything to it, you'll need to use a slightly different Bazaar
        command the first time you push anything to the branch:</p>

      <p>
        <code>bzr push lp:~userid/project-name/branch-name --use-existing-dir</code>
      </p>
