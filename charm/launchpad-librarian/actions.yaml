clear-storage:
  description: |
    Clear local librarian storage.  This irreversibly deletes data, so it
    requires the host name of this librarian instance to avoid accidentally
    clearing the wrong instance, and it always refuses to clear storage for
    the Launchpad production instance.  It is useful when the associated
    database has been reset.
