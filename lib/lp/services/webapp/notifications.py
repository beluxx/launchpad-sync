"""Browser notification messages

Provides an API for displaying arbitrary notifications to users after
an action has been performed, independent of what page the user
ends up on after the action is done.

Note that the current implementation is deliberately broken - the only way
to do this correctly is by passing a token in the URL to identify the
browser window the request came from.
