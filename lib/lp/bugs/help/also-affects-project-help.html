      <h2>Adding another target to a bug report</h2>

      <p>
        The same bug can crop up in different places.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine a bug in a video driver. Not only do the video driver
        maintainers need to fix the bug in their code but so do the people who
        package that driver for Ubuntu and other distros.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, the version and packaging of that driver may differ between
        different releases of a particularly distro.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the bug may initially be reported against X.org or some other part
        of the operating system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Launchpad helps manage this by allowing bug reports to relate to more
        than one context.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, if you suspect that an existing bug also affects another project
        or distribution you can add it to the report. That bug report, with
        the same number and comment history, will then show up just like any
        other bug report for that project/distro.
      </p>

      <h3>Where you can report a bug</h3>

      <p>
        Launchpad can track bugs for:
      </p>

      <ul class="bulleted">
        <li>projects</li>
        <li>project series</li>
        <li>project groups</li>
        <li>distributions</li>
        <li>distro series</li>
        <li>source packages</li>
        <li>distro series source packages.</li>
      </ul>
