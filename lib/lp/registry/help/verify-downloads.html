      <h2>Verifying a download</h2>

      <p>
        There are two ways to check the files you've downloaded from a
        project:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>using the MD5 sum that Launchpad generates</li>
        <li>optionally, using the digital signature generated if the uploader
          signed the file.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The difference between the two is that the MD5 lets you check the file
        hasn't changed between leaving Launchpad and arriving on your machine,
        whereas the signature lets you check that the file hasn't changed
        since it was signed.
      </p>

      <h3>Using the MD5 sum</h3>

      <p>
        When a project maintainer uploads a file that they want to make
        available for download, Launchpad analyzes the file using the MD5
        hashing algorithm. This produces a short sequence of letters and
        numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can use that sequence, called the MD5 sum, to check that the file
        has arrived on your machine intact.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the MD5 sum by following the <code>md5
        </code> link next to the file you've downloaded.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Open a terminal, enter the directory where
        you downloaded the file and type:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>md5sum filename</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        Obviously you need to replace <em>filename</em> with the name of the
        file you downloaded.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> You'll see an MD5 sum. Check that it's the
        same as the one you obtained in step 1. If the two sums are different,
        there has been a problem downloading the file. You should delete the
        file and try downloading it again. Do not use the file if the MD5 sums
        do not match.
      </p>

      <h3>Verifying a signature</h3>

      <p>
        When a project maintainer uploads a file to Launchpad, they have the
        option of also digitally signing the file and uploading the resultant
        signature.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can tell which files have a signature by looking out for the
        <em>sig </em> link alongside the <em>md5</em> link. Verifying the
        files signature lets you check that the file is exactly as intended by
        whoever signed the file.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the signature file to the same
        directory where you've downloaded the project file you want to verify.
        The signature file will have the same name as the project file you've
        downloaded but with <em>.asc</em> or <em>.sig</em> appended to the
        end.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Open a terminal, change to the directory
        where you have saved the file and accompanying signature, then enter
        the following:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>gpg --verify <em>signaturefilename</em></code>
      </p>

      <p>
        Replace <em>signaturefilename</em> with the signature's filename.
      </p>

      <p>
        gpg will now try to check the signature against the signer's public
        key. If your version of gpg is configured to retrieve public keys
        automatically, you can skip to step 4. Otherwise, you'll need to fetch
        the signer's public key manually.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> If gpg can't find the public key on your
        local system, it will give you an error message similar to this:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>gpg: Signature made Sun 28 Jun 2009 02:20:52 BST using DSA key ID 2F9532C8<br />
        gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        That's no problem: you can easily retrieve the public key. Simply copy
        the key ID; it's the alphanumeric code, <code>2F9532C8</code>, at the
        end of the first line of the error message.
      </p>

      <p>Next, enter:</p>

      <p><code>gpg --recv-keys 2F9532C8</code></p>

      <p>
        gpg will now pull down the public key and you can re-run <code>gpg
        --verify <em>signaturefilename</em></code>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> We're nearly done! You'll see a message from
        gpg that is similar to this:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>gpg: Signature made Sun 28 Jun 2009 02:20:52 BST using DSA key ID 2F9532C8<br />
        gpg: Good signature from "Guillermo Gonzalez &lt; guillermo.gonzalez@canonical.com&gt;"<br />
        gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!<br />
        gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.<br />
        Primary key fingerprint: CDD8 87C2 C5CE CD1A C593  8EEF 698A D97E 2F95 32C8</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        This message shows that the file hasn't changed since it was signed by
        the uploader. Because Launchpad allows only a project's owners and
        series release managers to upload files for download, you may decide
        that this is enough confirmation that the file is good.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, you can verify that the public key is owned by someone that
        you trust from the project.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Visit <a href="https://launchpad.net/people"
          target="_blank">Launchpad's people
          search</a> page and search for the person name in the output from
        <code>gpg --verify</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        From their profile page, you can check their involvement in the
        project and also that they own the key used to sign the file you
        downloaded.
