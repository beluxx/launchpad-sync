subordinate: false
requires:
  db:
    interface: pgsql
  # A direct connection to the primary database, bypassing pgbouncer.
  # (full-update.py disables access via pgbouncer to the primary database
  # for the duration of the update, so we must have direct access.)
  db-admin:
    interface: pgsql
  # A connection to the pgbouncer load balancer.  The schema update process
  # uses this to check for long-running connections and to disable access to
  # the primary database for the duration of the update.
