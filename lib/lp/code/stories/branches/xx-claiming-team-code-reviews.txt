Claiming Team Code Reviews
==========================

When a team has been requested to review a merge proposal, any member of that
team can claim that review.  This can be done by clicking on the "[Review]"
link shown in the reviewer table for the team.

    >>> # Logging in as an admin helps with setting things up.
    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> eric = factory.makePerson(
    ...     name="eric", email="eric@example.com",
    ...     displayname="Eric the Viking")
    >>> vikings = factory.makeTeam(
    ...     owner=eric, displayname="Vikings", name="vikings")
    >>> trunk = factory.makeProductBranch(owner=vikings)
    >>> trunk.product.development_focus.branch = trunk
    >>> branch = factory.makeProductBranch(
    ...     owner=eric, product=trunk.product)
    >>> branch_url = canonical_url(branch)
    >>> logout()

    >>> eric_browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic eric@example.com:test")
    >>> eric_browser.open(branch_url)
    >>> eric_browser.getLink('Propose for merging').click()
    >>> eric_browser.getControl('Description of the change').value = (
    ...     'This fix is awesome!')
    >>> eric_browser.getControl('Propose Merge').click()

The reviewer table shows both the Vikings team and Eric himself.

    >>> print(extract_text(find_tag_by_id(
    ...     eric_browser.contents, 'code-review-votes')))
