create-bot-account:
  description: >
    Create a bot account.  This is intended mainly for use within
    Canonical's infrastructure, and so makes some assumptions around SSO
    account creation and team membership that only hold there; people
    running it elsewhere will need to set the "openid" and "teams"
    parameters.
  params:
    username:
      type: string
      description: Username for the bot.
    openid:
      type: string
      description: >
        OpenID identifier suffix.  When used from Canonical's service
        manager infrastructure, this is unnecessary because SSO account
        creation handles it.
