      <h2>Syncing software from a parent series</h2>

      <p>
        Syncing software from a parent series will take the package that's
        currently published in it, and upload it to the derived series without
        you having to use command line tools such as <em>dput</em> or
        <em>ftp</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Syncing a package from the parent series
        will supersede any changes made in the derived version. If there are
        local changes you don't wish to lose, you will need to manually merge
        the changes into the upstream package and upload that to the derived
        series.
      </p>

      <h3>Checking the differences</h3>

      <p>
        Each row in the table shows a package that has different versions in
        the derived series and the parent(s). Clicking the package name
        will expand the row to show more details about the package and allow
        you to take some actions:
      </p>

      <ul class="bulleted">
        <li>Add a comment about this package.</li>
        <li>Request debdiffs</li>
        <li>Ignoring this difference, or all differences for this package</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Adding comments</h4>
      <p>
        Click the green "Add comment" button and enter the comment inline.
        All previous comments are shown here also.
      </p>

      <h4>Requesting debdiffs</h4>
      <p>
        Click the "Compute differences from last common version". A request is
        sent to the server to initiate the debdiff calculation. While you wait
        for the calculation the icon will flash. The page will update
        automatically when the debdiff becomes available, giving you a link to
        download the debdiff file.
      </p>

      <h4>Ignoring differences</h4>
      <p>
        If you don't care about this package you have the option of setting it
        to <em>ignored</em>, which means that it will no longer appear in the
        list. You can choose to ignore just "These versions", which means if a
        new version is uploaded it will re-appear, or "All Versions" which
        means you won't see it again unless you search explicitly for ignored
        packages in the search criteria at the top of the page.
      </p>

      <h3>Requesting a sync</h3>
      <p>
        There are two methods of syncing:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>A mass-sync:</dt>
        <dd>This grabs all packages in all parents that have a higher version
          and uploads them to the derived series by clicking the mass-sync
          button at the bottom of the page. To do this you need to have
          archive administrator permissions.</dd>
        <dt>A selective sync:</dt>
        <dd>You can check the box next to each package and then click the sync
          button at the bottom of the page. To do this you need to have
          permissions to upload each package.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        After you request a sync the operation will complete in the background
        and the package(s) will flow into the distribution just like a normal
        upload, including being held in the upload queue as appropriate.
