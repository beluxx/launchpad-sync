"""Interface for branch targets.

A branch target is the 'thing' that a branch is on. Branches in Launchpad are
owned by an IPerson and can be either junk branches, product branches or
package branches. A branch target is the product or package that a branch is
on. If the branch is a junk branch, then the target is the branch owner.
