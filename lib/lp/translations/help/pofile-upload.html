      <h2>Uploading an updated .po file</h2>

      <p>
        When you download a .po file from Launchpad, update it, and then
        upload your edited .po file back to Launchpad, it will be treated
        the same as if the translations had been made using Launchpad's web
        interface.
      </p>

      <h3>Structuring the .po file</h3>

      <p>
        Launchpad will only accept the .po file if it has the
        <code>X-Exported-From-Launchpad</code> header. That header is
        automatically added when you export a .po file from Launchpad.
      </p>

      <p>
        The easiest way to ensure Launchpad accepts your .po file as an
        update is to export a .po file from Launchpad, edit only the
        strings and then upload it back to Launchpad.
