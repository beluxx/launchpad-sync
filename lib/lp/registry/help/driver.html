      <h2>What is a project driver?</h2>

      <p>
        The project driver is a person or team who is responsible for setting
        the direction for the project. The driver can set goals, approve bug
        targeting, or set backporting for <strong>any</strong> major series in
        the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you can chose to leave the project driver unset and
        appoint a team for each series.
