      <h2>Pocket for snap builds</h2>

      <p>Each distribution series in a package repository is divided into
        several parts, called <em>pockets</em>. These refer to different
        update streams that users of that series may wish to use. You can
        similarly choose to build snap packages based on any of those
        different update streams.</p>
      <p>If unsure, choose <strong>Updates</strong>.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Release</dt>
        <dd>The package versions that were published when the distribution
          release was made.</dd>
        <dt>Security</dt>
        <dd>Package versions containing security fixes for the released
          distribution. Packages in <em>Security</em> are built with
          dependencies from <em>Release</em> and <em>Security</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Updates</dt>
        <dd>Updates for serious bugs that do not affect the security of the
          system. Packages in <em>Updates</em> are copied from
          <em>Proposed</em> or <em>Security</em> once they have been tested.
        </dd>
        <dt>Proposed</dt>
        <dd>The testing area for updates. This repository is recommended only
          to those interested in helping to test updates and provide feedback.
          Packages in <em>Proposed</em> are built with dependencies from
          <em>Release</em>, <em>Security</em>, <em>Updates</em> and
          <em>Proposed</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Backports</dt>
        <dd>As the name states, these are unsupported new versions of packages
          which have been backported to an older release. Packages may contain
          new features, may introduce new interfaces, and bugs. Packages in
          <em>Backports</em> are built with dependencies from
          <em>Release</em>, <em>Security</em>, <em>Updates</em> and
          <em>Backports</em>.
