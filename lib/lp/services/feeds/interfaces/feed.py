    Feeds in Launchpad are published using the Atom syndication standard, as
    defined by the proposed standard RFC 4287[1] or as HTML snippets.

    An Atom feed is an XML document consisting of a feed and zero or more
    entries.  The feed section describes the feed as a whole while the entries
    are descriptions of the individual components of that feed.  For instance
    the feed for "feeds.launchpad.net/ubuntu/announcement.atom" has metadata
    referring to the Ubuntu project and each entry in the feed represents a
    specific announcement.

    The components of IFeed are those data specifically for the feed.  The
    entry data is found in IFeedEntry.
