      <h2>Adding a new series</h2>
      <p>
        This page creates a new distribution series. The series can
        later be renamed and initialized with packages from a parent
        series.
      </p>
      <h3 id="codename">Code name</h3>
      <p>
        The code name for the new distribution series will form part of
        its URL, so choose carefully. The new series is also referenced
        by its code name throughout Launchpad while it's in a
        non-released state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the series is released, its version is used instead in
        titles, etc.
