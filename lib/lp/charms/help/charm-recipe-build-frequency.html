    <h1>Charm recipe build schedule</h1>

    <p>There are two options for when charm recipes get built:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Built automatically</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A build will be scheduled automatically once a change to the
          top-level source branch for the charm recipe is detected.</p>
        <p>If there has been a build of the charm recipe within the previous
          hour, the build will not be scheduled until an hour since the last
          build.</p>
        <p>If you really want the build to happen before the one-hour period
          is up, you can use the "Request builds" action.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Built on request</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Builds of the charm recipe have to be manually requested using
          the "Request builds" action.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
