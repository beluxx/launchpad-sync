LoginToken pages
================

Users interact with login tokens for operations that require the user to prove
they have access to a resource that is external to Launchpad. For example,
claiming an email address or a OpenPGP key require the user to use the login
token sent to them in an email.


Validating GPG keys
-------------------

In order to add a GPG key to Launchpad we require that the person
registering it decrypt an email and follow the instructions in it.
The last step in that workflow is the +validategpg page, which can
be accessed by non-logged-in users. That page will attempt to access
all email addresses of the requester but that may fail when the user
is not logged in and the requester has chosen to hide their email
addresses, so here we'll make sure that even non-logged-in users can
perform the last step of the workflow for adding a GPG key.

    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    >>> from lp.services.verification.interfaces.authtoken import (
    ...     LoginTokenType,
    ...     )
    >>> from lp.services.verification.interfaces.logintoken import (
    ...     ILoginTokenSet)
    >>> from lp.services.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> from lp.registry.model.person import PersonSet

    # To simplify our tests we'll use the PersonSet() class directly instead
    # of gettint it as a zope secured utility. If we don't do that we'd have
    # to remove the security proxy of the person objects all the time.
    >>> person_set = PersonSet()
    >>> login_token_set = getUtility(ILoginTokenSet)

    >>> sample_person = person_set.getByEmail('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person.hide_email_addresses
    True

    >>> login_token = login_token_set.new(
    ...     sample_person, 'test@canonical.com', 'test@canonical.com',
    ...     LoginTokenType.VALIDATEGPG,
    ...     fingerprint='A419AE861E88BC9E04B9C26FBA2B9389DFD20543')

    # Start our stub GPG keyserver so that the key can be fetched by the page.
    >>> from lp.testing.keyserver import KeyServerTac
    >>> tac = KeyServerTac()
    >>> tac.setUp()

    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     SERVER_URL='http://launchpad.test',

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS, request)
    >>> validategpg_view = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (login_token, request), name="+validategpg")

    validated...
