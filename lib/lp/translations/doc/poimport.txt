PO Imports
==========

The tale of a PO template and a PO file and how they get imported into
Rosetta.

Test Setup
----------

Here are some imports we need to get this test running.

    >>> from lp.app.interfaces.launchpad import ILaunchpadCelebrities
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> from lp.translations.enums import RosettaImportStatus
    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.translationimportqueue import (
    ...     ITranslationImportQueue)
    >>> import datetime
    >>> import pytz
    >>> UTC = pytz.timezone('UTC')
    >>> rosetta_experts = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).rosetta_experts

We need this for the Librarian to work properly.

    >>> import transaction

Here's a fake logger to capture any errors that happen.

    >>> from lp.services.log.logger import FakeLogger

Login as an admin to be able to do changes to the import queue.

    >>> login('carlos@canonical.com')


Importing a Template
--------------------

Normal procedure is to import a template, followed by translations. A
template is created first.  After that, imports are done using the
POFile.importFromQueue and POTemplate.importFromQueue methods.

    >>> distroseries = factory.makeUbuntuDistroSeries()
    >>> sourcepackagename = factory.makeSourcePackageName()

Here's the person who'll be doing the import.

    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> person = person_set.getByName('mark')

And this is the POTemplate where the import will be done.

    >>> potemplate = factory.makePOTemplate(
    ...     distroseries=distroseries, sourcepackagename=sourcepackagename,
    ...     owner=person)
    >>> potemplate_id = potemplate.id

This is the file that'll get imported.

    >>> potemplate_contents = six.ensure_binary(r'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "POT-Creation-Date: 2004-07-11 16:16+0900\n"
    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=CHARSET\n"
    ... "Plural-Forms: nplurals=INTEGER; plural=EXPRESSION;\n"
    ... "X-Rosetta-Export-Date: %s\n"
    ...
    ... msgid "foo"
    ... msgstr ""
    ...
    ... msgid "bar"
    ... msgstr ""
    ...
    ... #: test.c:13
    ... msgid "baz"
    ... msgstr ""
    ...
    ... #, c-format
    ... msgid "Foo %%s"
    ... msgstr ""
    ...
    ... #, c-format
    ... msgid "Singular %%d"
    ... msgid_plural "Plural %%d"
    ... msgstr[0] ""
    ... msgstr[1] ""
    ...
    ... msgid "translator-credits"
    ... msgstr ""
    ... ''' % datetime.datetime.now(UTC).isoformat())  # noqa

We sometimes saw deadlocks as POFile statistics were updated after
importing a template.  The operation would read all translation messages
for the entire template in the same transaction that did the import. To
prevent this, the importer now does intermediate commits while
recomputing statistics.

    >>> from lp.testing.faketransaction import FakeTransaction

Attach the import to the translations import queue:

    >>> translation_import_queue = getUtility(ITranslationImportQueue)
    >>> entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     potemplate.path, potemplate_contents, True, potemplate.owner,
    ...     distroseries=distroseries, sourcepackagename=sourcepackagename,
    ...     potemplate=potemplate)

The file data is stored in the Librarian, so we have to commit the
transaction to make sure it's stored properly.

    >>> transaction.commit()

The entry gets approved, so it can be imported.

    >>> entry.setStatus(RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED, rosetta_experts)

    >>> import datetime
    >>> import pytz
    >>> UTC = pytz.timezone('UTC')
    >>> saved_date = datetime.datetime.now(UTC)

Now, we tell the PO template to import from the file data it has.

    >>> (subject, body) = potemplate.importFromQueue(
    ...     entry, FakeLogger(), txn=FakeTransaction())

Our request has now been serviced.

    >>> print(entry.status.name)
    IMPORTED

The last update date is the one we got.

    >>> potemplate.date_last_updated > saved_date
    True

We don't send mail about successful imports.

    >>> print(subject)
    None

Since there was no error, the queue entry's error_output is blank.

    >>> print(entry.error_output)
    None

The correct message IDs now show up in the template.

    >>> potmsgsets = list(potemplate.getPOTMsgSets())
    >>> for potmsgset in potmsgsets:
    ...     print(potmsgset.msgid_singular.msgid)
    foo
    bar
    baz
    Foo %s
    Singular %d
    translator-credits

The file references field should be there

    >>> print(potmsgsets[2].filereferences)
    test.c:13


Import Preconditions
....................

The API for POTemplate.importFromQueue demands a translation import
queue entry to import.

    >>> potemplate.importFromQueue(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Attempt to import None entry.

The entry must have been approved for import.

    >>> potemplate.importFromQueue(entry)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Attempt to import non-approved entry.

The entry indicates what file it is to be imported to; importing it to
any other file would be an error.

    >>> entry.setStatus(RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED, rosetta_experts)
    >>> other_template = factory.makePOTemplate()
    >>> other_template.importFromQueue(entry)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Attempt to import entry to POTemplate it doesn't belong
    to.


Importing a Translation
-----------------------

Now let's get a PO file to import.

    >>> pofile = potemplate.newPOFile('cy')
    >>> pofile_id = pofile.id

By default, we got a safe path to prevent collisions with other IPOFile.

    >>> print(pofile.path)
    unique-...-cy.po

Let's override the default good path with one we know is the right one.

    >>> pofile.setPathIfUnique(u'po/cy.po')

It's newly created, so it has only one translation which is the
translation credits.

    >>> pofile.getPOTMsgSetTranslated().count()
    1

And the statistics reflect it.

    >>> pofile.currentCount()
    1


Import With Errors
..................

Here are the contents of the file we'll be importing. It has some
validation errors.

    >>> pofile_with_errors = six.ensure_binary(r'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "PO-Revision-Date: 2005-06-03 19:41+0100\n"
    ... "Last-Translator: Carlos Perello Marin <carlos@canonical.com>\n"
    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    ... "Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=(n==1) ? "
    ...     "0 : n==2 ? 1 : (n != 8 || n != 11) ? 2 : 3;\n"
    ... "X-Rosetta-Export-Date: %s\n"
    ...
    ... msgid "foo"
    ... msgstr "blah"
    ...
    ... #, fuzzy
    ... msgid "bar"
    ... msgstr "heffalump"
    ...
    ... msgid "balloon"
    ... msgstr "blah"
    ...
    ... #, c-format
    ... msgid "Foo %%s"
    ... msgstr "blah %%i"
    ...
    ... #, c-format
    ... msgid "Singular %%d"
    ... msgid_plural "Plural %%d"
    ... msgstr[0] "Foos %%d"
    ... msgstr[1] "Bars %%d"
    ... msgstr[2] "Welsh power! %%d"
    ... msgstr[3] "We have four! %%d"
    ... ''' % datetime.datetime.now(UTC).isoformat())  # noqa

This is the dbschema that controls the validation of a translation.

    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.translationmessage import (
    ...     TranslationValidationStatus)

The process of importing a PO file is much like that of importing a PO
template. Remember, we need to tell the system that this po file is an
"imported" one.

    >>> entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     pofile.path, pofile_with_errors, True, person,
    ...     distroseries=distroseries, sourcepackagename=sourcepackagename,
    ...     potemplate=potemplate)
    >>> transaction.commit()

The guess IPOFile should be the same we already had.

    >>> entry.getGuessedPOFile().id == pofile.id
    True

Set it as the place where the entry should be imported.

    >>> entry.pofile = entry.getGuessedPOFile()

We must approve the entry to be able to import it.

    >>> entry.setStatus(RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED, rosetta_experts)

And we do the import.

    >>> (subject, body) = pofile.importFromQueue(entry, FakeLogger())
    >>> flush_database_updates()

The status is now IMPORTED:

    >>> print(entry.status.name)
    IMPORTED

Three translations have been properly imported. Note that the translation
"balloon" -> "blah" is considered as current, even though "balloon" does
not appear in the POTemplate.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy

    >>> def show_translation_details(translationmessage, pofile):
    ...     print(translationmessage.potmsgset.singular_text, end=' ')
    ...     print(
    ...         pretty(removeSecurityProxy(translationmessage.translations)),
    ...         end=' ')
    ...     print(translationmessage.potmsgset.getSequence(pofile.potemplate))
    >>> for translationmessage in pofile.translation_messages:
    ...     if translationmessage.is_current_ubuntu:
    ...         show_translation_details(translationmessage, pofile)
    translator-credits
        ['This is a dummy translation so that the credits
         are counted as translated.'] 6
    foo ['blah'] 1
    balloon ['blah'] 0
    Singular %d
        ['Foos %d', 'Bars %d', 'Welsh power! %d', 'We have four! %d'] 5

And the statistics reflect it. (Note that only translations with a
sequence number greater than 0 are counted, hence the translation
"balloon" -> "blah" does not appear in currentCount().)

    >>> pofile.currentCount()
    3

Here's a current message: i.e. it has a corresponding current message
set in the PO template.

    >>> message = pofile.translation_messages[1]
    >>> print(message.potmsgset.singular_text)
    foo

And should be accepted by our validator.

    >>> upstream_message = message.potmsgset.getOtherTranslation(
    ...     pofile.language, pofile.potemplate.translation_side)
    >>> upstream_message.validation_status == TranslationValidationStatus.OK
    True

Fuzzy translations are ignored.

    >>> def get_pofile_translation_message(pofile, msgid):
    ...     potmsgset = pofile.potemplate.getPOTMsgSetByMsgIDText(msgid)
    ...     return potmsgset.getCurrentTranslation(
    ...         pofile.potemplate, pofile.language,
    ...         pofile.potemplate.translation_side)
    >>> message = get_pofile_translation_message(pofile, u'bar')
    >>> print(message)
    None

Check that the plural form was imported correctly.

    >>> potmsgset = pofile.potemplate.getPOTMsgSetByMsgIDText(
    ...     u'Singular %d', u'Plural %d')
    >>> imported_translationmessage = potmsgset.getOtherTranslation(
    ...     pofile.language, pofile.potemplate.translation_side)
    >>> print(imported_translationmessage.validation_status.name)
    OK

    >>> for translation in imported_translationmessage.translations:
    ...     print(translation)
    Foos %d
    Bars %d
    Welsh power! %d
    We have four! %d

The owner for those translations should be Carlos, instead of the person
that did the upload, because the imported file states that Carlos is the
translator.

    >>> print(imported_translationmessage.submitter.displayname)
    Carlos Perelló Marín

The import process produces an email warning us of partial failure, but
doesn't send it out for published uploads (indicated with subject of
None).

    >>> print(subject)
    None

    >>> print(body)
    Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
    <BLANKLINE>
    On ..., you uploaded 5
    Welsh (cy) translations for ... in Launchpad.
    <BLANKLINE>
    There were problems with 1 of these translations.
    <BLANKLINE>
    4. "format spec... 'msgid' and 'msgstr' for argument 1 are not the same":
    <BLANKLINE>
    #, c-format
    msgid "Foo %s"
    msgstr "blah %i"
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    The other 4 translations have been accepted.
    <BLANKLINE>
    ...

The error information is also stored more compactly in the entry's
error_output.

    >>> print(entry.error_output)
    Imported, but with errors:
    <BLANKLINE>
    4. "format spec... 'msgid' and 'msgstr' for argument 1 are not the same":
    <BLANKLINE>
    #, c-format
    msgid "Foo %s"
    msgstr "blah %i"


Import With Warnings
....................

The import may also succeed but produce syntax warnings.  These need not
be tied to particular messages (they could be in the header, for
instance) and they don't mean that any messages failed to import.

For example, here's a gettext PO file with two headers.

    >>> pofile_with_warning = six.ensure_binary(r'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    ... "X-Rosetta-Export-Date: %s\n"
    ...
    ... # Second header.  This elicits a warning.
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    ...
    ... msgid "x"
    ... msgstr "y"
    ...
    ... msgid "a"
    ... msgstr "b"
    ... ''' % datetime.datetime.now(UTC).isoformat())  # noqa
    >>> eo_pofile = potemplate.newPOFile('eo')
    >>> warning_entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     'eo.po', pofile_with_warning, False, potemplate.owner,
    ...     distroseries=distroseries, sourcepackagename=sourcepackagename,
    ...     potemplate=potemplate, pofile=eo_pofile)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> warning_entry.setStatus(RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED, rosetta_experts)
    >>> (subject, message) = eo_pofile.importFromQueue(warning_entry)

The warning is noted in the confirmation email.  Note that this
particular warning condition is recognized fairly late, so the line
number points at the next message.  There's not much we can do about
that, but it should help a bit.

    >>> print(message)
    Hello ...
    This mail is to notify you that all translations have now been
    imported.
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    There were warnings while parsing the file.  These are not
    fatal, but please correct them if you can.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Line 12: We got a second header.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Thank you,
    <BLANKLINE>
    The Launchpad team

    >>> print(warning_entry.error_output)
    There were warnings while parsing the file.  These are not
    fatal, but please correct them if you can.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Line 12: We got a second header.

    >>> warning_entry.setStatus(RosettaImportStatus.DELETED, rosetta_experts)


Import Without Errors
.....................

Now, let's import one without errors. This file changes one translation
and adds another one.

    >>> pofile_without_errors = six.ensure_binary(r'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "PO-Revision-Date: 2005-06-03 20:41+0100\n"
    ... "Last-Translator: Foo <no-priv@canonical.com>\n"
    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    ... "Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=(n==1) ? "
    ...     "0 : n==2 ? 1 : (n != 8 || n != 11) ? 2 : 3;\n"
    ... "X-Rosetta-Export-Date: %s\n"
    ...
    ... msgid "foo"
    ... msgstr "new translation"
    ...
    ... msgid "baz"
    ... msgstr "zab"
    ...
    ... msgid "translator-credits"
    ... msgstr "helpful@example.com"
    ... ''' % datetime.datetime.now(UTC).isoformat())
    >>> entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     pofile.path, pofile_without_errors, True, rosetta_experts,
    ...     distroseries=distroseries, sourcepackagename=sourcepackagename,
    ...     potemplate=potemplate)
    >>> transaction.commit()

The new upload clears the entry's error_output.

    >>> print(entry.error_output)
    None

The guess IPOFile should be the same we already had.

    >>> entry.getGuessedPOFile().id == pofile.id
    True

Set it as the place where the entry should be imported.

    >>> entry.pofile = entry.getGuessedPOFile()

We must approve the entry to be able to import it.

    >>> entry.setStatus(RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED, rosetta_experts)

We do the import.

    >>> (subject, body) = pofile.importFromQueue(entry, FakeLogger())

The status is now IMPORTED:

    >>> print(entry.status.name)
    IMPORTED

Since the translations from the older imports are still present,
we now have four current translations.

    >>> for translationmessage in pofile.translation_messages.order_by('id'):
    ...     if (translationmessage.is_current_ubuntu and
    ...         translationmessage.potmsgset.getSequence(pofile.potemplate)
    ...         > 0):
    ...         show_translation_details(translationmessage, pofile)
    Singular %d
        ['Foos %d', 'Bars %d', 'Welsh power! %d', 'We have four! %d'] 5
    foo ['new translation'] 1
    baz ['zab'] 3
    translator-credits ['helpful@example.com'] 6
    >>> pofile.currentCount()
    4

This time, our notification email reports complete success, except
that nothing is emailed out (subject is None) because this is an upstream
upload.

    >>> print(subject)
    None

    >>> print(body)
    Hello Rosetta Administrators,
    <BLANKLINE>
    ...

There was no error output either.

    >>> print(entry.error_output)
    None

The translation has been augmented with the strings from the imported
file.  The translation credits are special; upstream uploads can
"translate" credits messages to provide translator names, but since
credits for translations in Launchpad are generated automatically, non-
upstream translations for these messages are ignored.

    >>> message = get_pofile_translation_message(pofile, 'foo')
    >>> print(message.msgstr0.translation)
    new translation

    >>> message = get_pofile_translation_message(pofile, 'translator-credits')
    >>> print(message.msgstr0.translation)
    helpful@example.com


Import Preconditions
....................

The API for POFile.importFromQueue demands a translation import queue
entry to import.

    >>> pofile.importFromQueue(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Attempt to import None entry.

The entry must have been approved for import.

    >>> pofile.importFromQueue(entry)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Attempt to import non-approved entry.

The entry indicates what file it is to be imported to; importing it to
any other file would be an error.

    >>> entry.setStatus(RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED, rosetta_experts)
    >>> other_pofile = potemplate.newPOFile('de')
    >>> other_pofile.importFromQueue(entry)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Attempt to import entry to POFile it doesn't belong to.

Even importing a translation into its own template is wrong; it must be
the exact right POFile.

    >>> potemplate.importFromQueue(entry)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Attempt to import entry to POTemplate it doesn't belong
    to.


Plural forms handling
---------------------

Apart from the basic plural form handling, which is documented above as
part of the import process, there are some peculiarities with importing
plural forms we want documented as well.

For a language that has no plural forms defined, we
default to two plural forms (the most common value for the number of
plural forms).

    >>> language = factory.makeLanguage()
    >>> print(language.pluralforms)
    None

    >>> potemplate = factory.makePOTemplate(
    ...     distroseries=distroseries, sourcepackagename=sourcepackagename)
    >>> pofile = potemplate.newPOFile(language.code)
    >>> pofile.plural_forms
    2

We'll import a POFile with 3 plural forms into this POFile:

    >>> pofile_with_plurals = six.ensure_binary(r'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "PO-Revision-Date: 2005-06-03 19:41+0100\n"
    ... "Last-Translator: Carlos Perello Marin <carlos@canonical.com>\n"
    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    ... "Plural-Forms: nplurals=3; plural=(n==0) ? 0 : ((n==1) ? 1 : 2);\n"
    ... "X-Rosetta-Export-Date: %s\n"
    ...
    ... #, c-format
    ... msgid "Singular %%d"
    ... msgid_plural "Plural %%d"
    ... msgstr[0] "First form %%d"
    ... msgstr[1] "Second form %%d"
    ... msgstr[2] "Third form %%d"
    ... ''' % datetime.datetime.now(UTC).isoformat())  # noqa

We now import this POFile as this language's translation for the soure
package:

    >>> entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     pofile.path, pofile_with_plurals, True, person,
    ...     distroseries=distroseries, sourcepackagename=sourcepackagename,
    ...     potemplate=potemplate)

Allow the Librarian to see the change.

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> entry.pofile = pofile
    >>> entry.setStatus(RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED, rosetta_experts)
    >>> (subject, body) = pofile.importFromQueue(entry, FakeLogger())
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> print(entry.status.name)
    IMPORTED

If we get a current translation for this PO file, it will list only two
translations (which is a default when the language has no plural forms
specified):

    >>> potmsgset_plural = potemplate.getPOTMsgSetByMsgIDText(
    ...     u'Singular %d', u'Plural %d')
    >>> current = potmsgset_plural.getCurrentTranslation(
    ...     potemplate, language, potemplate.translation_side)
    >>> for translation in current.translations:
    ...     print(translation)
    First form %d
    Second form %d

However, even the third form will be imported into database (this is
useful for when we finally define the number of plural forms for the
language, we should not have to reimport all translations):

    >>> print(current.msgstr2.translation)
    Third form %d


Upstream import notifications
-----------------------------

Add a maintainer POFile import (i.e. from a package or bzr branch),
approve and import it.

    >>> pofile_contents = br'''
    ... msgid ""
    ... msgstr ""
    ... "PO-Revision-Date: 2005-05-03 20:41+0100\n"

    ... "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    ... "Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=(n==1) "
    ...     "? 0 : n==2 ? 1 : (n != 8 || n != 11) ? 2 : 3;\n"
    ...
    ... msgid "foo"
    ... msgstr "blah"
    ... '''
    >>> pofile = factory.makePOFile('sr', potemplate=potemplate)
    >>> by_maintainer = True
    >>> entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     pofile.path, pofile_contents, by_maintainer, person,
    ...     distroseries=distroseries, sourcepackagename=sourcepackagename,
    ...     potemplate=potemplate, pofile=pofile)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> entry.setStatus(RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED, rosetta_experts)
    >>> (subject, message) = pofile.importFromQueue(entry)

Import succeeds but no email is sent out.

    >>> entry.status == RosettaImportStatus.IMPORTED
    True

    >>> print(subject)
    None

For syntax errors, failure notification is still sent out.

    # Remove final quote from the contents, causing a syntax error.
