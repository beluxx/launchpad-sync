      <h2>Rock recipe build schedule</h2>

      <p>There are two options for when rock recipes get built:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Built automatically</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A build will be scheduled automatically once a change to the
            top-level source branch for the rock recipe is detected.</p>
          <p>If there has been a build of the rock recipe within the previous
            hour, the build will not be scheduled until an hour since the last
            build.</p>
          <p>If you really want the build to happen before the one-hour period
            is up, you can use the "Request builds" action.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Built on request</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Builds of the rock recipe have to be manually requested using
            the "Request builds" action.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
