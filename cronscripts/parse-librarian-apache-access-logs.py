"""Parse librarian apache logs to find out download counts for each file.

Thanks to the *huge* number of different LibraryFileAlias objects this script
will fetch when parsing multiple log files from scratch and the fact that we
overwrite storm's cache with something that caches *everything*, this script
may end up eating all your RAM. That shouldn't happen in general as we run
it multiple times a day, but if we ever fail to run it for more than a week,
we may need to add a hack (store._cache.clear()) to clear the cache after
updating the counts of every LFA, in order to get through the backlog.
