"""Methods dealing with interactions.

Almost everything in Launchpad relies on a security policy, in particular
retrieving utilities and accessing attributes.

Zope obtains the security policy by looking at the 'interaction', which is a
thread-local variable. If there is no interaction, one is likely to encounter
an error like:

  AttributeError("'thread._local' object has no attribute 'interaction'")

In Launchpad, we frequently refer to the state of having no interaction as
being "logged out".

Because one needs an interaction to do practically anything, and because
Launchpad allows anonymous access, it is possible to create an interaction
(informally, "log in") for a mythical anonymous user.

The object representing the logged-in user is called the "principal", and the
relationship between the principal and the interaction is called the
"participation".

In Launchpad and in standard usage, the participation is the request and the
principal is the requesting user. Although Zope has support for more than one
of these, we only ever allow one.

There are test helpers in `lp.testing._login`.
