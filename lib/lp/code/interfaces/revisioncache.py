    An `IRevisionCollection` is an immutable collection of revisions. It has
    three kinds of methods: filter methods, query methods, and count methods.

    Query methods get information about the contents of collection. At this
    time we only have `getRevisions` to return `Revision` objects from the
    cache.

    Filter methods return new IRevisionCollection instances that have some
    sort of restriction. Examples include `inProduct`, and `public`.

    Count methods just return a number.

    Implementations of this interface are not 'content classes'. That is, they
    do not correspond to a particular row in the database.

    This interface is intended for use within Launchpad, not to be exported as
    a public API.
